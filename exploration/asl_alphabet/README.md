I've decided that hosting this dataset on Github is not worth the trouble. (Even using LFS -- it's just too slow and clunkly to deal with 80,000 binary files.)

The data is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet) in almost exactly the form that intend on using it, so go ahead and download and unzip it yourself!
