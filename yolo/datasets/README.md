## ASL Alphabet Data Set

**Description:** Consists of 80000 images depicting Americal Sign Language fingerspelling signs. 

**Origin:** Dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet). The images themselves were extracted as frames from videos of a hand signing various letters/symbols under different lighting conditions.

I've decided that hosting this dataset on Github is not worth the trouble. (Even using LFS -- it's just too slow and clunkly to deal with 80,000 binary files.)

The data is on Kaggle in almost exactly the form that intend on using it, so go ahead and download and unzip it yourself!
